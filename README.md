## How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the Property Management Dashboard on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended)
- **Code editor** (VSCode, Sublime Text, or any text editor of your choice)
- **Node.js**: Required to run npm commands. Install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Tailwind CSS**: The project uses Tailwind CSS, so it needs to be built before running.

### Steps 
**It is possible to run by opening the `index.html` file(if the tailwind CSS build is fine).

1. **Clone the Repository** 
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talha373/property-management-dashboard.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**
Change into the project directory:
```bash
cd property-management-dashboard
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
Install the necessary npm packages (including Tailwind CSS) by running:
```bash
npm install
```

4. **Build Tailwind CSS**
After installing dependencies, you need to build the Tailwind CSS files. Run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```

5. **Open the Project Folder**
Open the project folder in your code editor and ensure the build process is complete. Then, open the `index.html` file.
